> The new IDs (`SUR-006/007`, `BEH-011..016`, `CTR-008..012`,
> `INV-005..007`, `CST-006`, `DLT-001`, `IMP-015..020`, `OQ-010/011`) are

> `BL-001` records the current implementation/test/schema baseline.
> It stays `proposed` until a non-agent owner explicitly approves the

## 1. Context

`sdd-cli` is a generic command-line helper for Spec-Driven Development.
It computes a `freshness_token` over a configurable Discovery scope,
compares the current scope state against the value recorded in a
spec's Brownfield-baseline block, and emits machine-readable stubs
(`Delta` / `Open-Q`) describing scope drift since the recorded baseline
commit.

The mechanism is fixed (`git_tree_hash_v1`), but the tool is generic:
every SDD-following repo configures it through a small JSON file
(`.sdd/config.json`). The CLI is read-only on the spec — it never
rewrites normative spec content (SDD §0: auto-rewrite would be a
silent-removal back-door).

This spec governs **only** the construction of `~/Projects/sdd-cli/`.
Adoption inside any consumer repository (e.g. `pipeline-driver/`) is
out of scope — see §18.

---

## 2. Glossary

- **Token** — hex-encoded sha256 over the byte stream produced by
  `git ls-tree HEAD -- <discovery_scope>`. Identifies the exact
  tree-shape of Discovery scope at a commit.
- **Discovery scope** — array of git pathspecs (directories, files,
  globs) declared in `.sdd/config.json#discovery_scope`. Defines what
  the token covers.
- **Footprint** — the union of file paths reachable from the
  `binding` field of every `IMP-*` (Implementation binding) block in
  the spec file.
- **Baseline block** — the YAML block in `<spec_file>` whose `id`
  equals `<config.baseline_id>` and whose `type` is
  `BrownfieldBaseline`. Holds `freshness_token` and
  `baseline_commit_sha`.
- **Stub** — a YAML fragment emitted to stdout by `sdd refresh`
  describing one path of scope drift; either a `Delta` stub (path is
  inside an IMP footprint) or an `Open-Q` stub (path is in scope but
  outside any footprint).
- **Scope-clean working tree** — `git diff --quiet HEAD --
  <discovery_scope>` exits 0.
- **Scope-dirty working tree** — same command exits non-zero.

## 4. Brownfield baseline

```yaml
---
id: sdd-cli:BL-001
type: BrownfieldBaseline
lifecycle:
  status: proposed
partition_id: sdd-cli
discovery_scope:
  - src
  - tests
  - schema
  - package.json

coverage_evidence:
  - kind: git_tree_hash_v1
    reference: f420cd37ba313f66de248ee64e61d7f502b48f38
    note: |
      Token covers implementation, tests, schema, and build metadata.
      spec/spec.md and .sdd/config.json are intentionally outside this
      repo's own Discovery scope because BL-001 stores the token inside
      spec/spec.md; including that file would make the token
      self-referential.
freshness_token: a783836987d96042561de0f1489938fd17bd8596df2a156f87af49bfb95cd3a6
baseline_commit_sha: f420cd37ba313f66de248ee64e61d7f502b48f38
mechanism: git_tree_hash_v1
notes: |
  Brownfield baseline carries no preserved as-is behavior by itself.
  BL-001 lifecycle remains proposed until a non-agent owner records an
  approval_record.

  v1.0.0 — MAJOR: `sdd approve` default mode no longer mutates spec
  files. It writes a typed attestation to `.sdd/plans/<plan_id>.yaml`;
  a separate `sdd finalize` invocation materialises the plan. The
  methodology classifies this as a predicate change on the Surface's
  user-observable post-condition (§1.5: predicate change = major).
  `sdd approve --inline` survives one minor of v1.x as a transitional
  shim with a stderr deprecation warning; removal scheduled for v1.1.0.
  Migration recipe: `old: sdd approve <args>` → `new: sdd approve <args>
  && sdd finalize`.
  v0.2.0 — added the `sdd approve` subcommand.

notes: |
  v0.3.0 — added the `sdd ready` subcommand. Closes the gate-3
  (implementation-valid) hole described in SDD §three gates: every
  `approved`/`deprecated` normative ID must have ≥1 executable test
  annotated `@covers <partition>:<id>`, every `removed` ID must
  have a test with the matching `compatibility_action`, and no
  `proposed`/`draft` IDs may exist outside `sandbox_paths`.
  Strict superset of `sdd lint` and `sdd check` — re-runs their
  semantics under one JSON envelope (kinds `aggregated_lint` and
  `aggregated_check`). Read-only on the working tree (INV-009);
  does not run tests (INV-008). Configured via
  `.sdd/config.json#partitions[*].{spec_paths,test_paths,sandbox_paths}`
  (extension to SUR-002 — see CTR-015), with the v0.1.0/v0.2.0
  flat config shape preserved as a single-partition shorthand.
  Marker grammar (CST-007) accepts one-or-more colon-separated
  lowercase partition segments; single-segment is the default and
  preserved unchanged from v0.2.0.

  v0.6.0 — adds the lint diagnostic `sdd:open-q-blocking` (ENF-059) to
  members.lint, mechanising the spec-valid rule "no unresolved
  Open-Q.blocking=yes". Minor bump per the append-only rule.
  v0.5.0 — adds the already-shipped ready violation kind
  `generated_artifact_structural_diff_unbumped` (ENF-019) to
  members.ready, which was emitted by the CLI since v1.0.0 but
  omitted from the published member list. Minor bump per the
  append-only rule.
  v0.4.0 — promotes diagnostic identifiers (sdd lint rule names and
  sdd ready violation kinds) from private string literals to a
  published Surface with explicit semver. The strings consumers grep
  for in CI logs and parse from `--format=json` output are the
  external contract; CTR-016 enumerates the canonical list.
  Append-only at minor: new lint rules and new ready violation kinds
  may be added without bumping major. Renaming or removing a
  diagnostic-ID is a major bump plus an alias_for entry retained for
  ≥1 minor. Coverage is mechanically enforced by INV-010
  (tests/unit/diagnostic-registry-coverage.test.ts).

  v0.4.0 — `sdd finalize` materialises attestations recorded under

  validates the proposed graph (every flipped ID's referenced IDs are
  >=approved post-flip), and atomically rewrites `lifecycle.status`
  + `approval_record` for every plan attestation. On graph violation
  it refuses and leaves spec files untouched.

given: |

    refresh runs in both, but the diff source differs:
      * scope-clean:  diff(baseline_commit_sha .. HEAD) restricted to scope
      * scope-dirty:  the above PLUS uncommitted scope-touching changes
                      vs HEAD
  - recorded baseline block exists with a baseline_commit_sha that
    resolves in this repo
when: user runs `sdd refresh` (with optional --format=json|human|yaml,
                               default yaml)
then: |
  process exits 0; stdout contains zero or more YAML stubs separated by
  `^---$` lines, in deterministic order (paths sorted ASCII-ascending,
  Delta stubs before Open-Q stubs for the same path is impossible
  because each path lands in exactly one bucket — see CTR-006).
  Each changed path yields exactly one stub:
    - path appears in the footprint of one or more IMP-* blocks
        => Delta stub naming the smallest IMP-id set whose binding
           covers that path, plus the IMP's target_ids
    - path is inside discovery_scope but outside every IMP footprint
        => Open-Q stub asking whether the path should be bound to a
           normative ID
  Working tree, spec_file, config file are not modified. The CLI never
  writes to spec_file (INV-002).
negative_cases:
  - no drift           => see BEH-007

title: sdd ready --against detects Surface semver cascade violations (ENF-004A)
given: |
  - cwd is a git repository
  - --against <ref> resolves to a parent commit, branch, or tag
  - between <ref> and HEAD, at least one normative ID reachable from a
    Surface has changed (predicate-bearing field OR content field)
  - the Surface's declared version bump is below the cascade-required level
when: |
  user runs `sdd ready --against <ref>`
then: |
  - exits 1
  - violation { kind: "surface_semver_cascade", id: <SUR-id>,
                expected: "major" | "minor",
                actual: "patch" | "minor",
                remediation: <message naming the driving IDs> }
  - the cascade pass runs only when --against is set; without it, ready
    behaves exactly as in v0.3.x (no semver-cascade pass)
applicability:
  invariant_to_all_axes: true
data_scope: not_applicable
applicability_reason: read-only diff over git history; no persistent state
policy_refs:
  - sdd-cli:POL-001
notes: |
  v0.4.0 ships the cascade detector as a normal violation (exit 1 on
  detection). The plan author originally suggested ramping severity from
  warn → error; for sdd-cli we land it at error directly, since the
  --against flag is opt-in and CI policies decide whether to gate on it.
test_obligation:
  predicate: |
    With a fixture two-commit repo where commit B changes a Contract's
    schema, ready --against A on B emits surface_semver_cascade for the
    Surface that contains the Contract.
  test_template: integration
  boundary_classes:
    - schema change (predicate_change → major required)
    - notes change (content_change → minor required)
    - no change (patch required, no violation)
    - --against unset (no cascade pass at all)
  failure_scenarios:
    - cascade pass runs without --against
    - silent acceptance of a major-required Surface bumped only minor

applicability_reason: read-only diff over git history
policy_refs:

notes: |
  ENF-019 distinguishes "library shape changed" from "API contract changed".
  Even content-level changes in a published GA (field order, generated symbol
  names, wire format) are breaking for downstream consumers compiling against
  the artifact, so the rule requires major regardless of whether the diff was
  classified as predicate_change or content_change.
test_obligation:
  predicate: |
    A fixture two-commit repo where commit B mutates a published
    GeneratedArtifact triggers exactly one
    generated_artifact_structural_diff_unbumped when the parent Surface bumps
    minor. With published_surface=no, the rule is silent. With no GA diff,
    silent.
  test_template: integration

title: semver cascade is computed, not asserted
always: |
  When `sdd ready --against <ref>` runs, the semver-cascade pass classifies
  diffs and computes the *required* Surface bump per Surface in the partition
  view. The CLI never enforces a particular declared bump on the Surface
  records themselves; it only emits a `surface_semver_cascade` violation when
  the declared bump is below the computed required level. The Surface's
  `version` field stays under the consumer's editorial control.

## 11. Localization

`LocalizationContract` — `not_applicable: english_only_cli`. Reason: v1
exposes only English diagnostic and help text on stderr; no boundary
error messages are part of contract (errors are identified by the
exit-code taxonomy CTR-002 + machine-readable `reason` strings, never
by free text). When a future release adds localized output, that change
will land as a new `LocalizationContract` ID with `text_is_contract:
yes` for any error code whose text downstream parsers depend on.

    change_request: approve sdd-cli v0.3.0 ready surface incl. multi-segment partition prefix grammar (DLT-002 cohort)
    scope: first-time-approval
partition_id: sdd-cli
constraint: |
  `sdd ready` recognises traceability markers of the form
    @covers <partition>:<id> [<key>=<value>]*
  where:
    - <partition> matches ^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*(:[a-z][a-z0-9-]*)*$
      (one or more lowercase tokens joined by ':'; single-segment
      remains the default and is preserved bit-for-bit from v0.2.0)
    - <id> matches ^[A-Z]+(?:-[A-Z]+)*-\d+$
    - <key>=<value> tail tokens are split on the first `=` per
      whitespace-separated token; tokens whose key is not in the
      v0.3.0 whitelist {`compatibility_action`} are silently ignored
      (forward-compat for future v0.x keys; see OQ-016).
  Parsing is two-stage to avoid the JS/TS regex foot-gun where a
  single capture group with `*` keeps only the last match:
    stage 1 — /@covers\s+([a-z][a-z0-9-]*(?::[a-z][a-z0-9-]*)*:[A-Z]+(?:-[A-Z]+)*-\d+)([^\n\r]*)/g
              captures <partition>:<id> as a single group and the raw
              tail. Partition and id are split at the LAST `:` of the
              capture (rightmost-`:` is unambiguous because the id
              tail `[A-Z]+(?:-[A-Z]+)*-\d+` contains no `:` — implementation MUST
              use `lastIndexOf(":")`, not `indexOf(":")`).
    stage 2 — tokenise the tail by whitespace, split each token on
              first `=`, filter by the whitelist.
  The scanner is language-agnostic: it reads bytes from files
  matched by `partitions[*].test_paths` with no AST or syntax
  awareness. Adopters in TS, Py, Go, and Rust all work the same way.
rationale: |
  Markers must remain greppable, IDE-friendly, and stable across
  consumer languages. AST scanning would force per-language tooling
  and add supply-chain surface (one parser per ecosystem). The
  per-key whitelist keeps the v0.3.0 contract narrow while leaving
  room to grow without breaking older specs. The multi-segment
  partition grammar is a strict superset of v0.2.0: every v0.2.0-
  valid marker remains valid; single-segment adopters see byte-
  identical scanner output. Multi-segment support unblocks adopters
  that namespace their partitions (e.g. `bridge:commands:CON-004`).
scope:
  - src/features/ready/domain/MarkerParser.ts
test_obligation:
  predicate: |
    For every test file under `partitions[*].test_paths`, every
    `@covers <p>:<id> [k=v ...]` line is detected; partitions/IDs
    that do not match the documented charset are not detected; tail
    tokens with keys outside the v0.3.0 whitelist do not contribute
    to the parsed marker tail; multiple markers on the same line
    are detected. The single-capture-group regex foot-gun is
    explicitly ruled out by a test with three `key=value` pairs in
    one tail. Multi-segment partition prefixes are split at the
    rightmost `:` so that `@covers bridge:lock:BEH-001` yields
    partition=`bridge:lock`, id=`BEH-001`.
  test_template: unit

  settings.json are parsed with the built-in JSON, never a new dependency
  (consistent with CST-006).
rationale: |
  install distributes the methodology rules, so the rule files must be in the
  published tarball. A data-driven manifest lets the rule set evolve without
  touching install code and keeps the in-context/on-demand split declarative.
  Holding the dependency tree at {yaml} preserves the narrow supply-chain

## 14. Migrations

`Migration` — `not_applicable: greenfield_no_data_at_rest`. Reason:
`sdd-cli` is a stateless CLI. No persistent data shape evolves across
runs. The only persistent state the CLI reads (the consumer repo's
`spec.md` and `.sdd/config.json`) is owned by the consumer's spec
governance, not by `sdd-cli` itself. Future addition of an
`sdd cache` or `sdd init` (out of scope, §18) would introduce
Migrations.

## 15. Deltas

`Delta` — for v1.0.0 the section was `not_applicable:

description: |
  Adds one new CLI subcommand (`sdd ready`) without altering existing
  token/check/refresh/lint/approve behaviour. The v0.1.0 surfaces
  (SUR-001..SUR-005) and v0.2.0 surfaces (SUR-006, SUR-007) are
  unchanged. A new optional `partitions` block is added to
  `.sdd/config.json`; absence of the block preserves v0.2.0
  behaviour (graceful degradation per CTR-015).

  `sdd ready` is a strict superset of `sdd lint` and `sdd check`:
  internally it reuses the same parsing/check engine (lifted into
  `src/shared/domain/` for cross-slice reuse), but externally it is
  the single authoritative command CI calls. Adding it as a required
  check in protected-branch policy is sufficient to close the gate-3
  (implementation-valid) hole described in SDD §three gates: every
  `approved`/`deprecated` normative ID must have ≥1 executable test
  with `@covers <partition>:<id>`, every `removed` ID must have a
  `compatibility_action=…` test, no `proposed`/`draft` ID may exist
  outside `sandbox_paths`, and aggregated `lint`/`check` blockers
  (unresolved `Open-Q.blocking=yes`, weasel-words, missing
  `approval_record`, stale `freshness_token`) surface under the
  same envelope.

  v0.3.0 also widens the partition-prefix grammar in CST-007 (and the
  partition-name pattern in CTR-015) from one to one-or-more colon-
  separated lowercase segments. Single-segment adopters (sdd-cli
  itself) see byte-identical behaviour because `lastIndexOf(":")` on
  a one-colon string equals `indexOf(":")`. Multi-segment adopters
  (e.g. gatehouse) gain credit on existing
  `@covers <a>:<b>:<TYPE>-<NNN>` markers as soon as the corresponding
  `partitions["<a>:<b>"]` entry is declared in `.sdd/config.json`.

  The change is purely additive at every Surface; existing v0.2.0
  consumers see identical behaviour.
tests_old_behavior:
  - existing token/check/refresh/lint/approve integration tests stay
    green (no behavioural regression in the v0.1.0 / v0.2.0
    surfaces)
  - existing argv unit tests stay green (v0.2.0 flag set is preserved)
  - existing fs-readonly probe stays green for the new `sdd ready`
    invocation path (extends to INV-009)

  - to:sdd-cli:INV-008
  - to:sdd-cli:INV-009
  - to:sdd-cli:CST-007
caveats:
  - BL-001's `freshness_token` is stale w.r.t. the v0.3.0 source
    tree (added ~10 files under src/features/ready/ and a small lift
    of pure-domain code from src/features/lint/ + src/features/check/
    into src/shared/domain/). A separate `sdd refresh` run is
    required to regenerate the token; this Delta documents the
    intent of the change but does not itself update BL-001 (per
    SDD §6.5).
  - v0.3.0 ships these IDs in `proposed` status. Approval is the
    human owner's gate (SDD §7.5). Until approved the IDs are
    `proposed` and not `implementation-valid`.
  - The lifted shared-kernel modules (SpecRecord, LintRules,
    CheckOutcome) preserve identical observable behaviour for `sdd
    lint` and `sdd check`. Re-export shims remain in the original
    slices for backward compatibility within this PR; future PRs
    may inline the shared-kernel imports and delete the shims.
  - README gains the verbatim "verifies traceability presence, not
    test fidelity" clause from the v0.3.0 design committee
    transcript. README content is not normatively spec-tracked, so
    this is documented here rather than as a separate normative ID.

  Tightens the record-boundary predicate in findMatches (the shared

  open OR its indentation is sibling-or-shallower than the open record's
  anchor; a `- id:` nested deeper than the anchor (e.g. a Delta's
  `surface_impact:` entries) is record body.

  Before this change the scanner closed the open record at any `- id:`
  line regardless of indent, so a record whose `lifecycle:` anchor
  followed a nested `- id:` list was truncated before the anchor and
  `sdd approve`/`sdd finalize` flipped 0 files while still counting the
  id as matched.

  Restores INV-007/BEH-013/BEH-024/INV-012 conformance for such records.

  Adds a `--scope user|project` flag to `sdd install` (CTR-029), defaulting to
  `user`. With `--scope user` (the default) behaviour is byte-identical to
  today: writes go only under <home>/.claude and <home>/.codex, where
  <home> = $SDD_INSTALL_HOME else os.homedir().

  With `--scope project` the install writes into the project working tree at
  <project_root> = process.cwd(), using a repo-root memory layout:
    - <project_root>/CLAUDE.md   managed @import block; imports use the
                                 `@.claude/sdd/<file>` prefix
    - <project_root>/AGENTS.md   managed reference block; bullets use the
                                 `.codex/sdd/<file>` prefix
    - <project_root>/.claude/{sdd/**, skills/**, settings.json}
    - <project_root>/.codex/sdd/**
  PreToolUse hook commands in the project settings.json are written as
  `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/sdd/hooks/<file>.sh` so a committed settings.json
  is portable across machines.

  This is the first time install writes inside <repo_root>, so three approved
  boundary records change predicate:
    - INV-016 / POL-003: the "never inside <repo_root>" clause becomes
      scope-conditioned. Project scope writes only the agent-config set
      enumerated above and nothing else in the repo (never <config.spec_file>,
      .sdd/config.json, .git, or any source/test path).
    - POL-001: gains an explicit carve-out for `sdd install --scope project`,
      paralleling the existing per-command exceptions. The agent-config set is
      the only writable repo region; the spec/config/git read-only guarantee
      is preserved.
  A contractual Invariant/Policy predicate change cascades to the referencing
  Surface, so SUR-016 takes a MAJOR bump (0.1.0 -> 1.0.0). CTR-030 gains an
  optional `scope` field (minor, additive).

  --dry-run (BEH-069), invalid invocation (BEH-070), and missing-rules
  (BEH-071) behaviours are unchanged and apply to both scopes.
tests_old_behavior:
  - existing user-scope install integration and unit tests stay green
    (default scope == user; no path or output change without --scope project)
  - the user-scope "never writes inside the repo working tree" probe stays green
tests_new_behavior:

caveats:
  - "INV-016, POL-003, POL-001, CTR-029, CTR-030 are approved; their predicate/schema changes and the SUR-016 major bump are the human owner's gate (SDD §7.5). POL-003 is security-owned and POL-001 is partition-owned, so approval requires those non-agent identities. The agent drafts this Delta and BEH-072 as proposed and stops."
  - "BL-001's freshness_token goes stale once src/** and tests/** change; a `sdd refresh` plus token re-record is required before implementation-valid (mirrors DLT-001)."

    reason: finalize materialises surface_impact and gains the unflippable failure path
description: |
  Closes two finalize defects and adds a ready safety-net.

  finalize now materialises an approved Delta's surface_impact: it rewrites
  the target Surface.version to intended_version and unions Surface.members
  with the >=approved records that declare surface_ref to that Surface. This
  gives a legal path to evolve an already-approved Surface, which record set
  refuses to touch.

  finalize also rewrites the inline flow form `lifecycle: { status: ... }`,
  not only the block form, and its finalized_ids count reflects records whose
  status was actually rewritten; an id matched without a rewritable lifecycle
  anchor now fails finalize rather than counting as flipped.

  ready gains the violation kind surface_member_drift: it fires when a
  surface_ref child is missing from its Surface.members, or when an approved
  Delta's declared surface_impact intended_version has not been applied to the
  target Surface.version. The change is additive at every Surface; existing
  consumers see identical behaviour on inputs that were already consistent.

  The new rule surfaced one pre-existing drift in this spec: CTR-025 declares
  surface_ref SUR-008 but was never added to SUR-008.members. This Delta's
  surface_impact on SUR-008 reconciles it: finalising this Delta adds CTR-025
  to SUR-008.members and bumps SUR-008 to 0.6.0 through the new code path.
tests_old_behavior:
  - existing approve/finalize integration tests stay green (block-form flip,
    graph-violation refusal, byte-stable refusal path)
  - existing ready rule tests stay green (no false positives on consistent
    surfaces)
tests_new_behavior:
  - to:sdd-cli:BEH-073
  - to:sdd-cli:BEH-074
  - to:sdd-cli:BEH-075
caveats:
  - BL-001's freshness_token is stale w.r.t. the source added by this Delta
    (new ApplySurfaceImpact module, ready rule, registry kind). A separate
    sdd refresh run regenerates the token; this Delta documents intent but
    does not itself update BL-001.
  - v-next ships BEH-073/074/075 in proposed status. Approval is the human
    owner's gate (SDD §7.5); until approved the IDs are not implementation-valid.
  - SUR-008 / SUR-009 / SUR-010 version bumps and the CTR-016 members.ready
    append are applied as append-only minors; finalize materialises the SUR
    versions and the SUR-008 membership when this Delta is finalised.

  The predicate edits to the already-approved INV-003, CTR-004, CTR-003, and

  materialises the SUR-003 major and SUR-002 minor version bumps.

description: |
  The built-in git adapter's readAtRef (GitVcs, added in v1.3.0 alongside the
  Vcs port) shells `git show <ref>:<path>` to read a file at a revision for
  `ready --against` and `report --against`. The DLT-006 restructuring added
  this code path, and the git-shim allowlist guard test already permits
  `show`, but EXT-001's invocation list and POL-002's enumerated "MUST invoke
  only" set were not extended, leaving the approved allowlist behind the code.
  This Delta widens both to include `git show <ref>:<path>` as a read-only
  invocation.

  The invocation and predicate edits to the already-approved EXT-001 and
  POL-002 are applied by a one-off manual spec edit, sanctioned by the
  partition owner, because the CLI offers no in-place predicate-edit path for
  approved records. This Delta records that exception. No Surface references
  POL-002 or EXT-001, so finalising it materialises no version bump.
tests_old_behavior:
  - the five pre-existing git subcommands stay allowed and git-shim-allowlist
    stays green (POL-002)
  - existing token, check, refresh integration tests stay green
tests_new_behavior:
  - git show <ref>:<path> is inside the EXT-001 allowlist and the
    git-shim-allowlist ALLOWED_SUBCOMMANDS set includes show (POL-002)
  - readAtRef is exercised through ready --against and report --against
    integration tests against a real git binary (EXT-001)
caveats:
  - purely additive change; the old five-command allowlist is a subset of the
    new six-command allowlist, so nothing relying on the old set breaks.

  CST-007 pinned the normative-id tail to ^[A-Z]+-\d+$ (one uppercase type
  segment plus a numeric ordinal, e.g. INV-002). Adopters with descriptive
  policy ids such as pol:POL-AUTH-001 (tail POL-AUTH-001, two type segments)
  were accepted by record-id validation and lint, yet the @covers marker
  scanner rejected the same id, so the record could never be credited and
  sdd ready reported a permanent [uncovered] with no matching near-miss
  advisory. This widens the id tail to ^[A-Z]+(?:-[A-Z]+)*-\d+$ (one or more
  uppercase type segments joined by '-', then the '-<digits>' ordinal),
  closing that lint<->marker drift. It is a strict superset: every
  single-segment tail parses byte-for-byte identically, and the rightmost-':'
  split is unaffected because the tail still contains no ':'. The near-miss
  recogniser (BEH-053) is realigned to source the shared ID_TAIL_RE_SRC
  instead of a duplicated literal, so the two grammars cannot drift again.

  The predicate edit to the already-approved CST-007 is applied by a one-off
  manual spec edit, sanctioned by the partition owner, because the CLI offers
  no in-place predicate-edit path for approved records (same exception as
  DLT-007). CST-007 is a member of no Surface (SUR-008/ready lists
  CTR-013/014/015/025), so finalising this Delta materialises no version bump.
tests_old_behavior:
  - single-segment id tails (e.g. sdd-cli:BEH-006) parse byte-for-byte and stay
    credited; the charset-reject cases (lowercase / non-digit tails) stay
    rejected (MarkerParser.test.ts)
tests_new_behavior:
  - parseMarkers detects a multi-segment id tail (pol:POL-AUTH-001 yields
    partition=pol, id=POL-AUTH-001) (MarkerParser.test.ts)
  - sdd ready credits a policy-style multi-segment neutral id via its @covers
    marker — exit 0, zero uncovered (ready-multi-segment.test.ts)
caveats:
  - purely additive; the old single-segment tail grammar is a strict subset of
    the new grammar, so nothing relying on the old set breaks.

question: |
  When a discovery_scope entry is a glob that resolves to zero files at
  HEAD, should `sdd token` (a) error out (typo-protection) or
  (b) silently include nothing for that entry?
options:
  - id: a
    label: error_zero_match
    consequence: |
      Catches typos in config (for example `spec/0[0-9]-*.md` when no
      such files exist yet); rejects scope entries whose globs are
      empty at HEAD but become populated in later commits.
  - id: b

options:

question: |
  What is the exact shape of the `binding` field in IMP-* blocks?
  PLAN.md describes it as an object, but the value type is unstated.
  Possible value shapes per key: string path, array of string paths,
  nested object whose leaf values are paths.
options:
  - id: a
    label: union_string_or_array_or_nested
    consequence: |
      Footprint extractor walks any object/array/string tree under
      `binding` and collects every string-leaf as a path. Most flexible.
  - id: b

partition_id: sdd-cli
question: |
  When an IMP-* block has no `binding` field at all, should the
  footprint extractor (a) skip silently, (b) emit a warning to stderr,
  or (c) treat it as a config error?
options:
  - id: a
    label: skip_silently
    consequence: |
      Maximally permissive; an IMP that exists only to declare
      target_ids contributes no footprint paths and does not interact
      with refresh.
  - id: b
    label: warn_on_stderr
    consequence: |
      Same routing as (a) but flags the omission for human review.
  - id: c
    label: config_error
    consequence: |
      Strict; every IMP must carry binding; surfaces under-spec'd IMPs.

options:

      Human output stays terse; timestamp lives only in machine

      Every json output uses `format_version: 1`; future incompatible
      machine-readable changes bump the relevant Surface major version.

options:

    consequence: |
      `git status --porcelain -- <scope>` is part of dirty detection;

      refresh's uncommitted drift set.
  - id: b

partition_id: sdd-cli
question: |
  Should `sdd approve` refuse to promote a Surface to `approved` when one
  of its referenced Contracts/Policies is still `proposed` (transitive
  approval check, SDD §7.3-bis)? Current v0.2.0 behaviour: no transitive
  check — the operator may produce a Surface@approved with a Contract@proposed
  member, which a downstream `sdd lint` flags as `spec-invalid`.
options:
  - id: a
    label: enforce_in_approve
    consequence: |
      `sdd approve` refuses (exit 1, reason="proposed-references") when
      any transitively-referenced ID is below the target_status. Forces
      a strict approval order. Slightly slower (transitive scan).
  - id: b
    label: leave_to_lint
    consequence: |
      `sdd approve` is a pure local rewriter; the gate is `sdd lint`
      run after the rewrite. Simpler approve; one extra lint run.

partition_id: sdd-cli
question: |
  Should `sdd lint` recognise the canonical SDD §2 partition section
  ordering (18 sections starting "1. Context") as the only acceptable
  shape? sdd-cli's own spec.md uses a slightly different section list
  (Invariants is §8, External dependencies §9, Generated artifacts §10,
  Localization §11, Policies §12, Constraints §13). v0.2.0 lint applies
  the §2 shape only to files that contain a "## 1. Context" heading;
  spec/spec.md and any non-partition file is exempt. Is this the
  intended semantics?
options:
  - id: a
    label: opt_in_via_heading
    consequence: |
      Current behaviour. Files starting with "## 1. Context" get §2
      structure check; everything else is exempt.
  - id: b
    label: configurable_per_glob
    consequence: |
      `.sdd/config.json#lint.partition_glob` opt-in; only files matching
      the glob get the structure check. More explicit but adds config
      surface (CTR-012 extension).

question: |
  When `partitions[*].test_paths` globs of two partitions overlap,
  should a marker in a shared test file count as covering BOTH
  partitions, or should the operator be required to list the same
  file in each partition's test_paths array? v0.3.0 default: a
  test counts toward partition X iff its file matches X's
  test_paths glob — overlapping globs implicitly cross-credit; no
  global cross-credit table.
options:
  - id: a
    label: implicit_cross_credit_via_overlapping_globs
    consequence: |
      Operators relying on cross-partition coverage list the same
      file in both partitions' test_paths (or use overlapping
      globs). Implicit cross-credit is the documented mechanism;
      matches v0.3.0 default and the issue §Config schema clause
      "A cross-partition integration test that legitimately covers
      IDs from both A and B must appear in both partitions'
      test_paths."
  - id: b
    label: forbid_glob_overlap
    consequence: |

question: |
  What is the canonical YAML form of a `Test obligation` declared
  `not_applicable + reason`? Acceptance criterion #3 of `sdd ready`
  requires it: an approved ID without a `@covers` marker is
  exempted from the `uncovered` rule iff its `test_obligation` is
  `not_applicable`. This convention is not yet used in this
  repo's spec.
options:
  - id: a
    label: nested_object_with_reason_token
    consequence: |
      `test_obligation: { not_applicable: <reason_token>, reason: "<text>" }`
      mirrors the convention already used by `data_scope` and
      `policy_refs` (see CTR-001 lines 1184-1188 and BEH-008
      data_scope at line 712). Consistent with existing parser.
  - id: b
    label: separate_top_level_keys
    consequence: |
      Two flat keys: `test_obligation_not_applicable: <reason_token>`

  Should `sdd ready` rules respect a per-ID `applicability` field

options:

      v0.3.0 evaluates every rule uniformly. An ID whose

      scope.
  - id: b
    label: applicability_aware

  Which severity classes of `sdd lint` diagnostics surface as

options:
  - id: a

    consequence: |
      `aggregated_lint` includes every Diagnostic with `severity:

    consequence: |
      Surface a near-miss diagnostic on the offending line at

question: |
  ENF-010 (sdd:assumption-downgrade-approval) needs a precise trigger
  predicate. The upstream Plan 2 / methodology canonical writes the trigger
  as `parsed.blocking == "advisory"`. The current sdd-cli spec uses
  `blocking: yes|no` — there is no `advisory` value in use. Possibilities:

    a) the rule fires only on `blocking: advisory` (the Plan 2 literal),
       and sdd-cli's existing spec is vacuously compliant (no records fire).
       Future ASSUMPTIONs that downgrade themselves use `blocking: advisory`.
    b) `blocking: no` itself is the downgrade signal — every existing
       ASSUMPTION with `blocking: no` would need an approval_record by a
       human approver, materially changing the discipline of the spec.
options:
  - id: a
    label: literal_advisory_trigger
    consequence: |
      Implementation matches the Plan 2 literal. No spec churn for sdd-cli
      until a downgrade actually happens. Mismatch with the prose of SDD §7.5
      that talks about downgrading `blocking → advisory`.
  - id: b
    label: blocking_no_trigger
    consequence: |
      Every existing `blocking: no` ASSUMPTION now requires an approval_record
      by a human approver. Captures the SDD §7.5 intent more directly but
      adds spec-fix workload on every consumer adopting v0.4.x.
  - id: c
    label: both_trigger_with_severity_split
    consequence: |

## 19. Out of scope

The following are deliberately out of scope for `sdd-cli` v1 (mirrors
PLAN.md §Out of scope and adds the implications for downstream IDs):

- **Publication of `@cyberash/sdd-cli` to npm registry.** SUR-005 stays
  in local-path / `npm pack` consumption mode. Promoting to a public
  registry is a separate Surface bump.
- **Other token mechanisms** (`sha256_of_concat`, `git_tag_based`).
  CTR-003.mechanism is a closed enum at one value; expanding is a major
  bump on SUR-002 (CST-005).
- **General spec linter** (`sdd lint`) covering §12.2 enforcement.
  Separate Surface; not part of SUR-001.
- **Scaffolding command** (`sdd init`). Consumers hand-write
  `.sdd/config.json` from `tests/fixtures/config.example.json`. The separate
  `sdd install <all|claude|codex>` command (SUR-016) installs the SDD
  methodology rules and Claude hooks into the user-level agent config; it is
  in scope and distinct from project scaffolding.
- **Auto-application of stubs into spec.md.** INV-002 forbids it.
  Future `sdd apply` is a separate, future Surface with its own Policy
  and approval ceremony.
- **Adoption inside `pipeline-driver/`.** Follow-up plan, not this one.
- **Adoption inside `pipeline-state-mcp/`.** Separate concern.
- **CI integration recipes (GitHub Actions, GitLab, etc.).** README
  guidance only; no normative ID.
- **Computing the token against a ref other than HEAD.** No flag, no
  contract.
- **Localized output / message catalogs.** §11 defers; future
  `LocalizationContract` block when needed.
- **Performance characterisation of `git ls-tree` on very large repos.**
  No NFR in v1; acceptable behavior is "completes in time bounded by
  git itself".

## Appendix A — Token algorithm (`git_tree_hash_v1`)

Definition restated for unambiguous implementation; binds INV-001 and
INV-003.

1. Run `git diff --quiet HEAD -- <discovery_scope>`.
   - exit 0 → working tree clean on scope; continue
   - non-zero → BEH-002 path (reason "baseline-dirty")
2. Run `git ls-tree HEAD -- <discovery_scope>`. Capture stdout as raw
   bytes — no decoding, no normalisation, no sorting (git canonicalises
   by name).
3. `token = hex(sha256(stdout_bytes))`.
4. `commit_sha = hex(stdout of `git rev-parse HEAD`).strip()`.
5. Emit `{ token, commit_sha, mechanism: "git_tree_hash_v1", scope }`.

Determinism follows from: git's canonical `ls-tree` output for a fixed
commit and pathspec set is byte-identical across invocations on the
same git version family (CST-001 / EXT-001).
